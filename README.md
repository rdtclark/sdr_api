```
Example output

CampaignTest#test_perecentage_raised_should_be_correct = 0.00 s = .
CampaignTest#test_campaign_can_have_many_investments = 0.00 s = .
CampaignTest#test_should_get_paginated_index = 0.00 s = .
CampaignTest#test_percentage_raised_should_update_upon_new_investment = 0.00 s = .
InvestmentTest#test_total_multiples_invested_should_be_a_whole_number = 0.00 s = .
InvestmentTest#test_should_create_investment_with_valid_data = 0.00 s = .
```

### How to use
* to list all campaigns visit http://localhost:3000/api/v1/campaigns or use curl as below
```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url http://localhost:3000/api/v1/campaigns
```
* to create an investment using curl in your Terminal
```bash
curl --request POST \
--url http://localhost:3000/api/v1/investments \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
"total_multiples_invested": "10",
"campaign_id": "1"
}'
```

### How to run locally using Docker

* Install Docker here: https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/

* Generate rails skeleton app
```bash
docker compose run --no-deps web rails new . --force --database=postgresql
```
* Linux Only: (change the ownership of the new files, otherwise they are owned by the root user)
```bash
sudo chown -R $USER:$USER .
```
* Now Gemfile is created, build image
```bash
docker compose build
```
* This deployment has its own rails environment so we can bring up the app now. Note the port number is 3001.
```bash
docker compose up
# http://localhost:3001/api/v1/campaigns
# recommended soundtrack: https://open.spotify.com/track/6ByN6v7D5YUogv622VMGrk ü•Å
```
* All that remains is to prepare the database
```bash
docker compose run web rake db:prepare
```
